# **SafeWallet**
## **The easy and secure safe wallet**
Safewallet is the best way to get started with SAFE. Our simple, streamlined design is easy for beginners, yet powerful enough for experienced users.
## **Completely decentralized**
 Safewallet is a standalone SAFE client. It connects directly to the SAFE network using SPV mode, and doesn't rely on servers that can be hacked or disabled. Even if Safewallet the company disappears, the app will continue to function, allowing users to access their money at any time.

## **Desgined with new users in mind**
Simplicity and ease-of-use is Safewallet's core design principle. A simple recovery phrase (which we call a paper key) is all that is needed to restore the user's wallet if they ever lose or replace their device. Safewallet is deterministic, which means the user's balance and transaction history can be recovered just from the paper key.
